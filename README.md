# AI-Based Flight Delay, Cost & Emission Estimator ✈️  

An AI-powered tool that helps estimate **flight delays, operational costs, and environmental emissions**.  
This project combines data-driven insights with a clean user interface built using **Streamlit**.  

🌐 **Live Demo**: [AI Flight Estimator](https://aiflightestimator.streamlit.app)

## 🚀 Features  
- 📂 **Upload Dataset** – Upload your flight dataset (CSV/XLSX).  
- 🧠 **AI Processing** – Predicts **delays, costs, and CO₂ emissions**.  
- 📊 **Visualization** – Interactive charts & graphs for better insights.  
- ⚡ **Error Handling** – Supports both correct & incorrect datasets (shows results gracefully).  
- 🎨 **Modern UI** – Simple, professional, and user-friendly.
